- wall placement code uses +8px offset instead of logic
- - wall preview doesnt and is incorrect
- - wall collision is still determined by the tile that the preview is on
- food popup has a child undefined error
- farms release their workers but also duplicate them maybe
- glyph bbox doesnt work for a few seconds when first farm is placed
- keep doesnt line up for some reason. might be keep dims
- images in catalog get streched and look blurry
